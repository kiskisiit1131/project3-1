# This is Akvile, I believe that my strengths are in CSS. I like to make sure that my CSS is organized and I like to add in media queries to clean up the page and make it more responsive.
# My weakness is JavaScript, purely based off of the reason that I haven't practiced using it yet. I'm sure that after this project I will gain more experience.
